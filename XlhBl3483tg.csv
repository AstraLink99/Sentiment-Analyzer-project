@sames499,"Yash Bhai for me barca win the match before the game even started. Even if Madrid win it doesnot bother barca. Before the match everyone tells you how to stop barca form scoring the goal as in every match they score 4+ goals so how we stop them. Carlo also tells that you will see my plan of beating barca, you guys are playing home and still you are afraid and make a plan how to stop barca rather than how we score and what is our strength. They have to adopt to stop us rather that real has to adopt to stop them. In xavi era there was always a talk about how we stop vinicius and bla bla bla ... That's why they lost  now real are doing same as they afraid of barca. Barca won match before it was started."

@8yeasrsback,12 offside
@sarangjain3304,"Haaland does exactly what you said mbappe can’t do. Haaland drops 10 times and makes than run again 10 times. Man was offside just 8 times in entire last year and yaha mbappe ek match mein 8 baar. 
Making those run is basic quality for a top striker especially when you have that mad pace. 
Mbappe was horrible."
